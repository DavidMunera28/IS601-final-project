# Customer Journey or Sales Funnel 

## Frida Customer Journey

### Awareness
Organic Search, Social Media, Promotional Events

### Interest
A landing page featuring a hero text and image that informatively describes the solutions our company offers, which Frida realizes is relevant to the problem she's trying to solve (recent complaints about visitors/employees getting lost), as well as immediate links to customer testimonials/case studies from the front page.

### Action
A signup for a newsletter which covers topics such as information about our products, detailed customer testimonials, and notices of upcoming events and webinars that our company is sponsoring.

Our company offers a pilot program. This allows Frida to implement the software on a smaller scale initially, ensuring seamless integration with her existing systems before committing to a full deployment.

### Loyalty
An email promotion is immediately sent for our next informational webinar about our free trial program which will include a live demo/Q&A for one of our company's apps featuring one of our satisfied customers as a guest speaker.
