Friday reaches out to our sales team to receive a personalized consultation on the unique needs of her various facilities. These discussions highlight not only the flexibility of the software to be tailored to meet specific environment's needs, but also a consistent app design that is cross-trainable and easy for users to adopt, no matter what specific map type is being displayed.

The sales team emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of our solution, providing Frida with pricing plans that take into consideration her budget constraints.

Frida compares our software against other solutions she has been researching simultaneously, and we make it onto her shortlist.

### Action
After some consideration, Frida responds to our representatives that she's interested in the solution but has some integration concerns.

Our company offers a pilot program. This allows Frida to implement the software on a smaller scale initially, ensuring seamless integration with her existing systems before committing to a full deployment.

### Implementation
Our technical team works closely with Frida's team to develop and program maps of the facility that will be included in the pilot program, as well as requirements analysis and design of all specific features needed.

Our technical team works closely with Frida's IT department to provide hands-on assistance with the integration process, ensuring compatibility with other systems within her facility.

Our company provides dedicated customer support during the implementation phase, ensuring a smooth transition. Frida and her team receive training sessions to maximize the use of the software and address any immediate questions or concerns.

### Renewal
Our company remains engaged with Frida post-implementation, seeking feedback and providing regular updates on software improvements. This creates a long-term partnership, and demonstrates to Frida our commitment to ongoing customer success.

Frida proceeds to a Phase 2 full implementation after experiencing success with the pilot program.

Frida becomes part of a community of facility managers using and advocating for our software.

Frida becomes a highly referenceable, long-term customer. She agrees to be interviewed for a case study, and also to provide endorsements at live networking events.
