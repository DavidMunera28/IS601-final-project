# Setup Instructions

`npx create-next-app waywize` initialized Next.js files.

`npm run dev` runs local development server (must be run from the `IS601-final-project\waywize` directory).

`npm i @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/next-js @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion` installs Chakra UI (must be run from the `IS601-final-project\waywize` directory). From there, import ChakraProvider and wrap in root app container as described [here](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-guide).
