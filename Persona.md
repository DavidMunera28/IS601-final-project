## Frida Barns

Frida is a facility manager with 5-10 years of experience who oversees operations and navigation within large commercial spaces such as malls, large grocery store chains, airports, event centers, hotels, etc. Recently, she has heard complaints from visitors/employees of these facilities that they are finding themselves getting lost easily, or not knowing where to find what they need. 

Her goal is to streamline and enhance the visitor experience within the facilities she manages. She envisions a mapping solution that utilizes modern technology, but is still very easy to learn and use. She is currently exploring her options for solving this problem, but finds that many solutions on the market are either too generic, too complex, or don't allow for enough customization between different spaces. 

She is trying to find an option that is flexible in its capabilities, but unified in its overall user experience. Furthermore, she is looking for solutions with excellent customer service to support her with design/setup, training, integration, and compatibility with other systems, as she does not have any developers in-house. She operates on a budget, so the solution also needs to be cost-effective without compromising on quality.
