# Initial Set

## Initiative Option One
"[Name of business] will enhance our online presence through a comprehensive redesign of our business webpage. This strategic initiative aims to improve user engagement and drive increased sales. 

Recent customer surveys have highlighted the fact that although clients view our products favorably, they initially encountered difficulty locating our business online through search engines. Upon reaching our website, they reported finding the layout somewhat confusing, which caused them to spend considerable time determining next steps to take after their initial interest. 

Respondents also noted that the benefits and features of our products were challenging to visualize through the website alone. For those without a pre-existing, clear need for our software, this may have acted as a potential deterrent from requesting a demo. 

Additionally, feedback indicated a desire for our website's design to more closely align with contemporary web design trends, reflecting a brand image that is perceived as technologically up-to-date."

## Epics Option One
- Redesign website navigation
- Add hero section to describe our products' purpose and benefits, and include a clearer call to action
- Add prominent customer testimonials to the landing page
- Add clear calls to action throughout website
- More clearly and concisely list out features and benefits. Go into a level of detail that is appropriate for the prospect's current stage in the customer journey (i.e. less detail for initial interest, more detail for desire phase)
- Improved SEO
- Ensure website meets all accessibility requirements

## Initiative Option Two
The company "insert name" is a small start up company that has been getting a lot of attention. However, the main problem that the company has been running into is that it is not getting enough recognition. 

Trying to find the company on google, or trying to search it up is nearly impossible. Once the company website is found, it does not do a good job on grabbing the users attention so they tend to click of the website pretty quickly. 

Their main goal is to hire a website developer in order to really get them out their and increase how much attention they are getting.

## Epics Option Two
- Easy to access website
- "Home" page of the website really grabs the users attention and keeps them interested
- On home page have them sign up for weekly emails to stay updated
- Nav bar is easy to navigate
