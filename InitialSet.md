## Initiative

Frida is looking for a new indoor and outdoor mapping/wayfinding software in response to complaints she's received about the navigability of the various facilities she oversees. She is interested in software-based options that seem easy to implement and use, but still afford her some flexibility to meet the needs of different types of facilities and venues.
