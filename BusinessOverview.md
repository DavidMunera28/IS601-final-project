# WayWize Business Overview

WayWize creates multi-platform applications used for indoor and outdoor mapping and wayfinding. Our brand archetypes are the Everyman and the Creator. In pursuing these archetypes, we appeal to not only business owners, space planners, and event organizers that our apps are primarily marketed toward, but also the day-to-day visitors to various facilities, venues, and localities that our clients are aiming to appeal to.

Our primary methods of persuasion are reciprocity, scarcity, consistency, and likeability.

Our persona is Frida, a facility management/planning expert who is looking to implement a new navigational experience for her businesses' various patrons. She wants a solution that is intuitive, innovative, and appealing. She oversees a variety of facility and venue types, whose diverse requirements we are equipped to meet while still providing a consistent user experience.

Unlike our competitors, we provide a small, agile, and communicative development team, budget-friendly implementation options, and original approaches to navigation/wayfinding utilizing AI and augmented reality.
